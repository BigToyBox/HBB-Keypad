# HBB-Keypad

I do a lot of prints using inlays and embedded nuts. My SV05 does not have a touch screen so I decided to give this BTT HBB button kit to give me the basic pause, resume, filament load, and filament unload without having to open Mobileraker on my phone. I set the the middle three buttons for heating up the bed, heating the extruder, and cool down. 

It is a handy little tool that was simple to set up. I made a v slot mount to attach it to my top rail.
